The previous AI engineer successfully established the core frontend architecture for a Pipedream clone, meticulously following the frontend first with mock data strategy. The initial phase involved creating essential pages (Landing, Dashboard, Agent Builder, Workflow, Templates, Agent Details) and populating them with mock data to demonstrate full functionality. A significant challenge encountered was the absence of a  directory and its required components, leading to multiple  errors. The AI engineer systematically debugged this by identifying the missing directory, recreating it, and populating it with necessary UI components (e.g., button, input, select) and utility files (, ). Dependencies like  and  were installed to support these components. The frontend is now fully functional with mock data, visually complete, and ready for backend integration as per the initial requirements.

<product_requirements>
The primary product requirement is to build a full-stack application cloning Pipedream.com, including its string and main functionalities, with integrated LLM capabilities. The specific LLM integration is with OpenRouter using the  model and a provided API key. The application must be a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. Key UI/UX guidelines emphasize motion, layered depth, bold typography, confident color use, grid-breaking layouts, ample whitespace, detailed quality, interactive storytelling, and performance optimization. The frontend has been implemented with mock data, featuring a professional landing page, an agent management dashboard, an AI agent builder, a visual workflow builder, a templates gallery, and a detailed agent configuration page. All interactive elements are functional using client-side data.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, Axios for API calls.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (via ),  for environment variables,  and  for data models, .
- **LLM Integration**:  library, specifically for OpenRouter DeepSeek.
- **Deployment/Runtime**: Supervisor for service control (frontend on 3000, backend on 8001), Kubernetes Ingress for routing  to backend.
- **Development Workflow**: Frontend-first with mock data, iterative debugging, explicit permission for automated testing.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   : The main entry point for the React application, responsible for setting up  and defining routes for different pages. Initially had a problematic  import which was removed.
-   : This directory contains the primary views of the application.
    -   : Displays the marketing content, features, and call-to-actions.
    -   : Manages agent overview, statistics, and logs.
    -   : Provides an interface for creating and configuring AI agents.
    -   : Facilitates visual workflow creation with drag-and-drop elements.
    -   : Showcases pre-built templates.
    -   : Displays detailed information and configuration for individual agents.
-   : This file centralizes all static mock data used by the frontend components. This is crucial for demonstrating functionality without a live backend.
-   : This newly created and populated directory holds a collection of reusable UI components (Shadcn UI equivalents) like , , , , , , , and . Their initial absence caused import errors, which were resolved by their creation and proper installation of related dependencies (, ).
-   : Provides a custom React hook for managing toast notifications throughout the application. It was initially present but was re-generated/modified when the UI components were created.
-   : Contains utility functions, notably  for conditional class joining and  for Tailwind CSS class merging, supporting the UI components.
-   : The FastAPI backend application. It defines the  route prefix and includes a basic  (root),  (POST), and  (GET) endpoint. It handles MongoDB connection and CORS configuration. It serves as the foundation for future backend API development.
-   : Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend, including , ,  (for MongoDB async driver), , and .
-   : Manages frontend dependencies, including React, React Router DOM, Axios, and various  packages for UI primitives, along with Tailwind CSS related packages.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement backend MongoDB models for core application entities (agents, workflows, templates, user data).
- Develop essential CRUD API endpoints in FastAPI for managing agents, workflows, and templates.
- Integrate the OpenRouter DeepSeek LLM into the backend for AI agent functionality.
- Replace all frontend mock data with live data fetched from the backend APIs.
- Conduct comprehensive backend testing using .
- After user confirmation, perform frontend testing using .

<current_work>
Currently, the previous AI engineer has successfully completed the entire frontend implementation of the Pipedream clone, which operates entirely with mock data. This includes all necessary pages to simulate the full user experience: a ,  for agent management, an  for creating AI agents, a  for visual task orchestration, a  gallery, and an  page for individual agent configuration. The UI adheres to modern design principles, featuring gradients, shadows, smooth animations, and responsive layouts.

A significant portion of the work involved resolving critical  errors that arose because the  directory, intended for Shadcn UI components, was missing and then subsequently created and populated. The engineer systematically added files such as , , , , , , , , along with utility files  and . Necessary frontend dependencies like  and  were also installed. The  was also updated to fix import paths and remove problematic references. The application is now visually complete and interactive client-side, providing a good and complete teaser of the final product.
